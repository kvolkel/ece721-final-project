This repository has the report for the final project completed for ECE 721 - Advanced Microarchitecture at NCSU. The main idea of this project is to study speculative value prediction speedups in a modern superscalar microprocessor. In our evaluation we consider several recovery methods when predictions are incorrect (perfect, dynamic, squashing at the time of instruction commit).
